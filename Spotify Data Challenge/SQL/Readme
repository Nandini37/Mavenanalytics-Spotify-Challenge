# Maven Analytics - Spotify Data Challenge

-- In this projecct we are going to analyze Spotify Top 100 songs in 2018.
-- It is based on Spotify streaming data, including name, artist 
-- and key attributes (danceability, energy, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, etc) 


-- Recommended Analysis
-- 1. Which artists had the most Top 100 songs?
-- 2. Are there more artists in the Top 100 with 'Lil' in their name, or with 'DJ' in their name?
-- 3. Which song attributes are most strongly correlated? What attributes seem to have very little correlation?
-- 4. Which attributes have the most variability? Which tend to be the most similar among the Top 100 songs?

-- 4. Which attributes have the most variability? Which tend to be the most similar among the Top 100 songs?

-- Interpretation: The greater the variance, the greater the spread in the data.
